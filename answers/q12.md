# Answer to question 12

**Question 12**

How would you design an algorithm to match pool riders for Lyft or Uber?

**Answer**
Here is one possible algorithm for matching pool riders for Lyft or Uber:

Collect data on past rides, including pickup and dropoff locations, times, and number of passengers.

Use this data to train a machine learning model, such as a decision tree or neural network, to predict the likelihood of two riders being on a similar route.

When a new rider requests a ride, use the trained model to find the most likely match among currently waiting riders.

Offer the matched riders the option to share the ride and split the cost.

If the matched riders accept the ride share, confirm the ride and send the driver the updated pickup and dropoff locations.

Continuously monitor and update the model based on feedback received from the matched riders and driver.

Additional feature like an ETA prediction model can be added to the algorithm to ensure that the matched ride is as efficient as possible.

Finally, A/B testing and monitoring of the algorithm can be implemented to ensure that it is working as desired.
