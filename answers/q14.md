# Answer to question 14

**Question 14**

How would you build a trigger word detection algorithm to spot the word “activate” in a 10 second long audio clip?

**Answer**

Here is one possible algorithm for building a trigger word detection algorithm to spot the word "activate" in a 10 second long audio clip:

Convert the audio clip to a spectrogram, which is a visual representation of the audio frequencies over time.

Use a deep learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), to analyze the spectrogram and identify the presence of the trigger word "activate."

Train the model on a large dataset of labeled audio clips, including examples of the trigger word "activate" as well as non-trigger words.

Use the trained model to predict whether the trigger word "activate" is present in new audio clips, and output the time range in which it is detected.

To improve the performance of the model, you can use techniques like data augmentation, fine-tuning, and regularization to increase the robustness of the model.

To improve the accuracy of the model, you can use techniques like transfer learning, which utilizes pre-trained models, and ensembling, which involves combining multiple models.

Finally, A/B testing and monitoring of the algorithm can be implemented to ensure that it is working as desired.
