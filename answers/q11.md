# Answer to question 11

**Question 11**

When you type a question on StackOverflow, you're shown a list of similar questions to make sure that your question hasn't been asked before. How do you build such a system?

Machine Learning System Design for StackOverflow-like question matching

Clarifying Requirements
The first step is to clarify the requirements of the problem. In this case, we need to build a system that can match a new question to a list of similar questions that have already been asked on the platform.

Some questions that should be asked to understand the scope:

How much data would we have access to? This would give an idea of the size of the dataset we would be working with, and whether a more complex model would be required.
How accurate does the system need to be? This would help in determining the appropriate metrics to use during evaluation.
How frequently would the system need to be updated? This would help in determining the appropriate training and retraining schedule.
How would the system handle new and unknown words or phrases?
Metrics

Once the requirements have been clarified, the next step is to determine the appropriate metrics to use when evaluating the system.

Offline metrics: These are used to score the model while it is being built. Examples of offline metrics include precision, recall, and F1 score.
Online metrics: These are used to score the model once it is in production and serving requests. Examples of online metrics include click-through rate and user engagement.
Architecture

The next step is to create a general architecture for the system. The architecture should include the following components at a minimum:

Data preprocessing: This step would involve cleaning and preparing the data for use in the model.
Feature extraction: This step would involve extracting relevant features from the data that would be used as input to the model.
Modeling: This step would involve training and testing the model using the extracted features.
