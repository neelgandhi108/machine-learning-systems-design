# Answer to question 10

**Question 10**

Autocompletion: how would you build an algorithm to finish your sentence when you text?

**Answer**
Machine learning system design for Autocompletion

Problem Statement
The problem is to build an algorithm that can predict the next word in a sentence given the context of the previous words. This will be used for autocompletion in a text input field.

Metrics
To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, we can use metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics will allow us to measure the accuracy of the algorithm in terms of how often it correctly predicts the next word in a sentence. Additionally, we can also measure the perplexity of the model, which is a measure of how well the model can predict the next word given the context of the previous words.

Architectural Components

Data Preprocessing: This component will be responsible for cleaning and preparing the data for the model. This may include removing stop words, stemming, and tokenizing the text.
Embedding Layer: This component will be responsible for mapping the words to a continuous vector space where mathematical operations can be performed. This can be done using techniques such as word2vec or GloVe.
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): The RNN layer will be responsible for processing the input sequence and generating a hidden state for each word in the sequence. This hidden state will be used as input for the next RNN layer.
Fully Connected Layer: This component will be responsible for generating the final output, which is the predicted next word.
Loss Function: This component will be responsible for comparing the predicted next word to the actual next word and computing the error.
Optimizer: This component will be responsible for adjusting the weights of the model to minimize the error.
Feature Engineering
n-grams: We can use n-grams of words as features for the model. This will allow the model to take into account the context of multiple words when making a prediction.
Part of speech tagging: We can use part of speech tagging as a feature to help the model understand the grammatical structure
