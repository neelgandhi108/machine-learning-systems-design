# Answer to question 16

**Question 16**

Facebook would like to develop a way to estimate the month and day of peopleâ€™s birthdays, regardless of whether people give us that information directly. What methods would you propose, and data would you use, to help with that task?

**Answer**
There are several methods that can be proposed to estimate the month and day of people's birthdays on Facebook, regardless of whether they give that information directly. Some of these methods include:

Social Media Profile Data: Use data from people's social media profiles, such as their posts, comments, and likes, to estimate their birthdays. For example, if someone frequently posts about their birthday or posts pictures from birthday parties, it is likely that their birthday is around that time.

Friend's Data: Use data from people's friends, such as the birthdays they have listed on their profile, to estimate the person's birthday. For example, if someone has a lot of friends whose birthdays are in June, it is likely that their birthday is also in June.

Demographic Data: Use demographic data, such as age, gender, location, etc., to estimate people's birthdays. For example, if someone is 25 years old and is a female, it is likely that her birthday is in June.

Image processing: Use image processing techniques to extract features from the user's profile picture, cover photo, and other photos uploaded by the user. Extracting features like age, gender, and facial attributes can give an idea of the birthday.

Natural Language Processing: Use natural language processing techniques to extract information from the user's text-based data like posts, comments, etc. This data can be used to extract the keywords related to birthdays, such as "happy birthday," "birthday party," etc.

Machine Learning: Use machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks to predict the birthday based on the combination of above-mentioned data.

It's important to note that even with the combination of above-mentioned data, the birthday prediction can be uncertain, and the predictions should be accompanied with a level of uncertainty. Also, the data should be collected and used with user's consent and in compliance with data privacy regulations.
