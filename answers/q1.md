# Answer to question 1

**Question 1**

Duolingo is a platform for language learning. When a student is learning a new language, Duolingo wants to recommend increasingly difficult stories to read.
	- How would you measure the difficulty level of a story?
	- Given a story, how would you edit it to make it easier or more difficult?

**Answer**

Measuring the difficulty level of a story:
There are several ways to measure the difficulty level of a story. One approach would be to use natural language processing techniques to analyze the text and extract features such as vocabulary complexity, sentence length, and grammatical structures. These features can then be used as input to a machine learning model that predicts the difficulty level of the story. Another approach would be to use human-annotated data, for example, by asking a group of language experts to rate the stories on a difficulty scale, and use this data to train a model.

Given a story, how would you edit it to make it easier or more difficult:
To make a story easier, one could simplify the vocabulary and grammar used in the story, use shorter sentences and more concrete examples, and provide more context and explanations. To make a story more difficult, one could use more complex vocabulary and grammar, use longer sentences, and provide less context and explanations.

Machine learning system design:

Collect and preprocess data: Collect a large corpus of stories in the target language, along with human-annotated difficulty level ratings. Preprocess the data by tokenizing, stemming, and removing stopwords.
Feature engineering: Extract features such as vocabulary complexity, sentence length, and grammatical structures from the text.
Model training: Train a machine learning model, such as a Random Forest or a Neural Network, using the extracted features and difficulty level ratings as input.
Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Deployment: Deploy the model in the Duolingo platform, to recommend increasingly difficult stories to read to the students.
Monitoring and maintenance: Monitor the model performance and update it regularly to improve its performance, also update the data and retrain the model as needed.
